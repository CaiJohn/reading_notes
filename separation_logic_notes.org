** What is logic?
   Concerned with the use and study of valid reasoning
   logic has three main parts: inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning and abductive reasoning
   The word logic can be used to described a field.
   But when we say propositional logic is a formal system.
** Inductive, deductive and abductive

** Formal language
   A language that is constrained by rules
** Well-formed formula (wff)
   A formula that is part of the formal language
** Formal system
   - Elements by Euclid
   - A finite set of symbols, a grammar, a set of axioms, a set of inference
** What is Hoare logic?
   - It is a formal system.
** What is separation logic?
   - An extension of Hoare logic. Easier to reason about shared mutable data strutures.
** Why separation logic is useful?
   - Example: reverse the linked list
   - separation logic operation already prohibit sharing
   - local reasoning
